# BlueSailsv2
BlueSails website redesign

The old design of BlueSails was inefficient and could use some visual touchups. Version 2 will seek to improve on rendering pages, components and overall navigation faster using a vite+react framework. Current pages of Version 1 can be seen in the images provided below. Version 2 will aim to keep the same minimilist design and overall functionalities but improve on efficiency and touch up a lot of the minor bugs with the website. For example, mobile rendering and overall layout is not optimized and the Google Calendar API usage has minor bugs which must be fixed.
